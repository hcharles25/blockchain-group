## ðŸ—“ Detailed Daily Plan

### Days 1-2: Blockchain Fundamentals (All Together)


* Blockchain basics: how blockchain works, consensus (PoW, PoS, PoH), accounts, transactions
* Ethereum and Solana architectures overview
* Smart contract concepts and dApps overview
* Wallets, transactions, gas fees, tokens (ERC20, NFTs)
* Tools overview: Remix, Hardhat, Anchor, Metamask, Phantom

*Use videos, docs, and interactive tutorials*
Example resources:

* [Blockchain Basics by Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography)
* [Solana Docs: Architecture Overview](https://docs.solana.com/introduction)
* [Ethereum Foundation Introduction](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/)

---

### Days 3-15: Individual Deep Dive + Team Sync

---

### Person A: **Smart Contract Developer (Solidity + Rust)**

* Day 3-6: Solidity basics + simple contracts (ERC20 token, simple storage)
* Day 7-9: Advanced Solidity (security, inheritance, gas optimization)
* Day 10-12: Rust basics + Solana program development with Anchor
* Day 13-15: Build and deploy small Ethereum & Solana contracts to testnets

---

### Person B: **Frontend & Blockchain Integration Developer**

* Day 3-6: Web3.js/ethers.js fundamentals + connect React to Ethereum contracts
* Day 7-9: Wallet integration (Metamask), read/write contract calls
* Day 10-12: Solana web3.js library + Phantom wallet integration
* Day 13-15: Build a full dApp UI connected to deployed contracts (Person Aâ€™s)

---

### Person C: **Testing, Security & Deployment Specialist**

* Day 3-6: Testing basics with Hardhat (Ethereum) and Anchor (Solana)
* Day 7-9: Learn security patterns and auditing basics
* Day 10-12: Deployment pipelines & scripts (Hardhat deploy, Anchor deploy)
* Day 13-15: Automate testing and deployment on testnets, integrate CI/CD basics

---

### Sync Meetings

* **Daily 1-hour team call** to share progress, challenges, teach each other, demo small projects
* Use a shared doc/Notion to keep track of resources, code snippets, and Q\&A

---

## ðŸš€ Final Thoughts

* Start strong with shared fundamentals to align knowledge
* Clear role separation optimizes learning given the limited time
* Focus on hands-on building after foundational theory
* Keep communication flowing daily for best results

If you want, I can help create a shared Notion template or checklist for this plan!
